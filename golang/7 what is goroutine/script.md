[Intro]

"Hey everyone! In this quick video, let’s talk about goroutines in Go and how they can help you with concurrent programming. Let’s dive in!"

[Step 1: What is a Goroutine?]

"Goroutines are lightweight threads in Go that allow you to run functions concurrently. They’re super easy to create with just the go keyword."

[Step 2: Start a Goroutine]

"Here’s how to start a simple goroutine in Go. Just use the go keyword before a function call like this:"

go
Copy code
package main

import "fmt"

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello() // This runs concurrently
    fmt.Println("Hello from Main!")
}
"Notice how sayHello runs in the background while the main function continues. But there’s a catch—we need to wait for the goroutine to finish before exiting."

[Step 3: Use Channels to Wait for Goroutine]

"To wait for the goroutine and get data from it, we use channels. Channels allow communication between goroutines. Here’s how you can do it:"

go
Copy code
package main

import "fmt"

func sayHello(ch chan string) {
    ch <- "Hello from Goroutine!"
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string) // Create a channel

    go sayHello(ch) // Start the goroutine

    // Wait and get the result from the goroutine
    message := <-ch
    fmt.Println(message)
}
"In this example, the main function waits for a message from the goroutine via the channel."

[Outro]

"And that’s a wrap! You just learned about goroutines and how to use channels to wait for them. Like and follow for more Go tips!"
