[Intro]

"Hey everyone! Today, let's quickly load test a website from the command line. Here's how you can do it using a simple Go script!"

[Step 1: Install hey](Install hey Tool)

"First, install the hey load testing tool by running this in your terminal:"

bash
Copy code
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
[Step 2: Run the Load Test

"Once installed, you can run a simple load test on your website with the following command:"

bash
Copy code
hey -n 1000 -c 50 https://yourwebsite.com
"Here, -n 1000 sends 1,000 requests, and -c 50 simulates 50 concurrent users."

[Step 3: Interpret the Results

"The output will show you important stats like requests per second, response time, and more!"

[Golang Example: Custom Load Test Code]

"If you want to write your own Go-based load tester, here’s a quick example using net/http."

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func loadTest(url string) {
	client := &http.Client{
		Timeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		resp, err := client.Get(url)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Error:", err)
			continue
		}
		resp.Body.Close()
	}
}

func main() {
	url := "https://yourwebsite.com"
	loadTest(url)
}
"This code makes 1,000 GET requests to the URL."

"And that’s it! Now you know how to load test your website using the CLI. Like and follow for more quick tips!"
