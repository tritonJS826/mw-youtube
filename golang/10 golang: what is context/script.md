[Intro]

"Hey everyone! Let’s quickly understand what context is in Go and why it’s important. Let’s dive in!"

[Step 1: What is Context?]

"In Go, context is a way to carry deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and goroutines."

[Step 2: Basic Usage]

"To create a context, we use context.Background() for the main context, or context.TODO() when we’re not sure. Here’s a basic example:"

go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    // Simulate a long-running task
    select {
    case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Task completed!")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Context canceled:", ctx.Err())
    }
}
[Step 3: Why Use Context?]

"Context is crucial for canceling operations, especially for tasks that can run in parallel. It helps you handle timeouts or gracefully shut down when a task is no longer needed."
