[Intro]

"Hey everyone! Let's do a quick comparison of SQL vs NoSQL databases and see how to interact with them using Go!"

[Step 1: What’s SQL?]

"SQL databases are structured and use tables to store data. Think of it as a big spreadsheet. It's perfect for complex queries and transactions. Here's how you can connect to a PostgreSQL database in Go:"

go
Copy code
import "github.com/jackc/pgx/v4"

conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Unable to connect to database:", err)
}
defer conn.Close(context.Background())
[Step 2: What’s NoSQL?]

"NoSQL databases are more flexible. They store data as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. Ideal for high-scale apps. Here's a quick example with MongoDB in Go:"

go
Copy code
import "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
import "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options"

client, err := mongo.NewClient(options.Client().ApplyURI("mongodb://localhost:27017"))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer client.Disconnect(context.Background())
[Step 3: When to Use SQL vs NoSQL?]

"Use SQL when you need structured data with complex relationships, like a banking system. Use NoSQL for unstructured or rapidly changing data, like social media posts."

"And that’s the quick breakdown! Choose the right tool for your project. Like and follow for more quick tips!"
