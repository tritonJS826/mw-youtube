[Intro]

"Hey everyone! Today, let’s quickly dive into concurrency in Go with sync.Mutex and sync.Map. Let’s go!"

[Step 1: sync.Mutex Basics]

"First, let’s see how sync.Mutex works. It helps us ensure that only one goroutine can access a critical section at a time. Here’s how to use it:"

Go Code:

go
Copy code
import "sync"

var mu sync.Mutex

func safeIncrement(counter *int) {
    mu.Lock()
    *counter++
    mu.Unlock()
}
[Step 2: sync.Map Basics]

"Now, let's look at sync.Map. It’s a thread-safe map that’s great for concurrent access. Here’s an example of using sync.Map:"

Go Code:

go
Copy code
import "sync"

var m sync.Map

func safeStore(key, value string) {
    m.Store(key, value)
}

func safeLoad(key string) (string, bool) {
    value, ok := m.Load(key)
    if ok {
        return value.(string), ok
    }
    return "", ok
}
[Step 3: When to Use Which?]

"Use sync.Mutex when you need exclusive access to a shared resource. Use sync.Map when you need a map that can be safely accessed concurrently by multiple goroutines."
