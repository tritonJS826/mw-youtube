[Intro]

"Hey everyone! Let’s quickly compare HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 and see how they differ in speed and performance. Here’s the breakdown!"

[Step 1: HTTP/1.1 Basics]

"First, HTTP/1.1 is the older version. Each request is sent separately, meaning it can be slow when loading multiple resources at once. For example, if you're requesting multiple images, your browser sends each request one by one."

[Step 2: HTTP/2 Improvements]

"Now, HTTP/2, the newer version, brings major improvements! It uses multiplexing, which means it can send multiple requests in one connection, drastically improving performance."

[Step 3: Go Example - HTTP/2 Server]

"Here’s a quick example of setting up a Go server with HTTP/2. You can use the http2 package like this:"

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"golang.org/x/net/http2"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	server := &http.Server{
		Addr: ":8080",
		Handler: http.FileServer(http.Dir("./static")),
	}

	http2.ConfigureServer(server, nil) // Enable HTTP/2
	log.Fatal(server.ListenAndServeTLS("cert.pem", "key.pem"))
}
[Step 4: Performance Benefits]

"With HTTP/2, you'll notice faster loading times for your site, especially on mobile, where connection speed is key."

"And that’s it! HTTP/2 is faster and more efficient. Like and follow for more web development tips!"
