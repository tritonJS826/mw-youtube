Today, let's dive into the Standard 3-Layer Architecture in Go, using the Gin framework. This structure is great for scalable applications, as it cleanly separates responsibilities across three layers: the Handler, Service, and Repository.

First, in the Handler or Controller layer, we manage HTTP requests. The handler receives requests, validates them, and then forwards them to the service layer.

Next is the Service layer. Here, we handle the business logic. The service acts as a bridge between the handler and repository, orchestrating data processing and business rules.

Finally, in the Repository layer, we interact with the database. The repository abstracts the data source, so the service doesn't need to know about database specifics.

And thatâ€™s it! This 3-layer architecture keeps your code organized and maintainable. With Gin, it's easy to implement each layer and scale your app as it grows. Like and subscribe for more Go tips!

Code Example (to show on screen)
```go
// Handler Layer
func GetUser(c *gin.Context) {
    userID := c.Param("id")
    user, err := userService.GetUser(userID)
    if err != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusNotFound, gin.H{"error": "User not found"})
        return
    }
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, user)
}

// Service Layer
type UserService struct {
    repository UserRepository
}

func (s *UserService) GetUser(id string) (*User, error) {
    return s.repository.FindByID(id)
}

// Repository Layer
type UserRepository struct {
    db *sql.DB
}

func (r *UserRepository) FindByID(id string) (*User, error) {
    var user User
    err := r.db.QueryRow("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = ?", id).Scan(&user.ID, &user.Name)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &user, nil
}
